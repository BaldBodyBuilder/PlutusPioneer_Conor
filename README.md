Howdy! This is a collection of my homeworks and notepad++ notes from following along with the provided series of lectures by Lars Brunjes
The link to the play list can be found here: [https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLK8ah7DzglhhJzuiz7X33UCHSTYPB-8Jt]
Most of my general notes I take on paper that I might upload some time in the near future but for now I have somethings typed in as comments on 
the files or other homeworks. 
I have applied to the second cohort so hopefully I can add another repo for when I am actually involved within the project!
